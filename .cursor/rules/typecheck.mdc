# TypeScript Type Checking

## Context
- When fixing TypeScript type issues
- When asked to fix or improve types
- When making type-related changes to the codebase

## Requirements
- Run `yarn typecheck` to identify all type issues
- Fix all type errors reported by the command
- Ensure type safety across the codebase
- Address each error in order of appearance
- Verify fixes with another `yarn typecheck` run

## Examples

### Process
1. Run `yarn typecheck` to get the list of type errors
2. Address each error systematically
3. After fixing, run `yarn typecheck` again to verify
4. Continue until all type errors are resolved

### Common Fixes
- Add missing type declarations
- Correct incorrect type assertions
- Fix incompatible type assignments
- Add necessary type guards
- Update interface definitions

## Notes
- Do not ignore type errors with @ts-ignore or similar comments
- Prefer explicit typing over 'any' type
- Maintain strict type checking standards
- Consider the broader impact of type changes on the codebase
